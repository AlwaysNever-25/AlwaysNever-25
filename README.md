"*Iâ€™ll tell you the story of the lost programmer in the realm of the Internet. This pathetic fool is bumbling around, hoping to change his future. Of course, many people come to know this person, wishing they would not end up like him. But no person, after knowing this fool, ever truly knows him. The reason? The programmer doesn't edit his README.md properly. And so the programmer finally did, and the README.md came to existence immediately. Thisâ€¦ is the short tale of the forgotten README.mdâ€™s forgetful owner. It is a tale of confusionâ€¦*"

# Introduction
Hi! My name is AlwaysNever, or Al for short. I'm a web- well, not really... wiki editor- well... a programmer? ðŸ˜… Anyway, I'm here to develop my programming skills in a multitude of ways, but I am mostly going to make it related to my hobby, which is editing wikis.
